  abstract = {Catch efficacy and bycatch are critical factors that determine the sustainability, practicality, and profitability of fishing gears. Inshore Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) fisheries commonly use gillnets, cod-pots, longlines and handlines. Owing to their efficiency, selectiveness, and low effort, gillnets are the most widely used gear. Gillnets however are prone to bycatch and low-quality catch. Handlines benefit from low capital investment, live high-quality fish, low bycatch, and low carbon footprint. Enhancements to handlines that could increase catch rate or size of catch would be considered beneficial and could promote uptake by harvesters using other gear types. Previous pilot research has shown that LED handline attachments that target the visual sensitivity of cod increased the catch rate of Atlantic cod. The present study builds upon this finding, incorporating three participating commercial crews and vessels. We found no significant effect of LED handline modifications on catch efficacy for Atlantic cod or bycatch. The bycatch of Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus) in our study was found to decrease with the use of green LEDs, but the data precludes complex statistical analysis. We discuss how these findings are relevant to small-scale fishers and provide an empirical reference regarding the use of such devices in the commercial fishery.},

  abstract = {Model selection is difficult. Even in the apparently straightforward case of choosing between standard linear regression models, there does not yet appear to be consensus in the statistical ecology literature as to the right approach. We review recent works on model selection in ecology and subsequently focus on one aspect in particular: the use of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or its small-sample equivalent, . We create a novel framework for simulation studies and use this to study model selection from simulated data sets with a range of properties, which differ in terms of degree of unobserved heterogeneity. We use the results of the simulation study to suggest an approach for model selection based on ideas from information criteria but requiring simulation. We find that the relative predictive performance of model selection by different information criteria is heavily dependent on the degree of unobserved heterogeneity between data sets. When heterogeneity is small, AIC or are likely to perform well, but if heterogeneity is large, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) will often perform better, due to the stronger penalty afforded. Our conclusion is that the choice of information criterion (or more broadly, the strength of likelihood penalty) should ideally be based upon hypothesized (or estimated from previous data) properties of the population of data sets from which a given data set could have arisen. Relying on a single form of information criterion is unlikely to be universally successful.},

  abstract = {Abstract European Union (EU) fishers need a range of gear options to comply with requirements under the landing obligation. Alternative fishing gears may be implemented provided equivalent selectivity can be demonstrated. Catch comparison is a valid method of testing the size selectivity of two or more fishing gears and simultaneous gear deployment helps minimize between-haul spatiotemporal variability in abundance. Non-simultaneous or alternate-haul deployments are generally required for single-rig trawls or seines nets. In those gears, matching consecutive test and control hauls helps minimize such variability. Random-haul matching strategies have also been employed where consecutive deployments are not logistically possible. Here, we investigated the effects of different matching methodologies by simulating a range of stylized scenarios of between-haul variation in abundance. We resampled data from a multi-rig catch comparison trial and emulated consecutive or randomly matched hauls. We examined how haul matching methodology influences catch curve estimates and uncertainty. Aiming for a balance in abundance across consecutively matched hauls is optimal, while random-haul matching may be the best strategy if neither balanced abundance nor consecutive hauls can be achieved. Based on these outputs, we provide practical guidance for experimental design during planning and at-sea operations to optimize trial outputs.},

We demonstrated how this can be achieved by using inclined panels to separate fish species into an upper codend with 90 mm T90-mesh, and Nephrops norvegicus into a lower codend with 80 mm diamond-mesh. A nested mixed effects model was developed to compare proportional catch at length of key species retained in test or control trawls, and based on this, the conditional probability of retention in the upper and lower test trawl codends. Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) \textexclamdown{} minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) were significantly reduced, while haddock {$\geq$} MCRS, Nephrops, cod (Gadus morhua), monkfish (Lophius piscatorius), and commercial flatfish catches were generally maintained in the test trawl. Model outputs demonstrated effective separation of Nephrops into the lower codend, and size dependent separation of haddock and whiting into the upper codend. Strong performance of this catch separation device facilitates alternative selectivity measures depending on landing obligation requirements. Additional benefits such as improved catch quality and reduced catch sorting times, but also the need for further incentives to encourage industry uptake are discussed.},

  abstract = {We assessed the impact of an additional 100~mm square mesh cylinder (SMC) on the selective property of the demersal whitefish trawl in the Celtic Sea. Sea trials were conducted on board a French trawler using twin trawl rigging. We tested the effects of the position of the SMC (in front of and behind the mandatory 100~mm square mesh panel) and of the insertion of a dispersive float. Selectivity analysis revealed the 50\% retention length (L50) to be greater than the Minimum Conservation Reference Sizes regardless of species (haddock, whiting or megrim) or rigging configuration. Results did not reveal a clear effect of the SMC position. However, the insertion of the float led to a decrease in selection ranges suggesting enhanced contact probabilities with the square meshes. With the largest L50 values, the SMC placed in the front position (and without the float) proved to be the most selective rigging configuration and was then tested under commercial conditions. Catch comparisons revealed that the test gear retained less fish across all size classes than the commercial gear. For haddock, the test gear retained less fish below 50~cm in length. Catch comparisons also indicated significant discards of fish above the MCRS, i.e. ``high-grading'' practices. Under the requirements of the landing obligation (LO), unwanted catches must be stored on-board and landed regardless of economic value. The SMC is thus a valuable tool to mitigate the impact of the LO on the demersal whitefish fishing fleets operating in the Celtic Sea.},

Bycatch rates vary spatially and temporally but over 30\% by weight of total catch are discarded at sea. The main bycatch and discard species comprise flatfish (summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus), scup (Stenotomus chrysops) and butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus). Videotape recordings and behavioral analysis of squid reactions have shown that squid display classical herding behavior and considerable swimming endurance in the forward part of the net. Loligo are shown to rise when dropping back towards the codend and in some cases to turn and rise on tiring. This behavior may be used to separate squid from the main bycatch species. Separator trawl test-trials have demonstrated that clear separation between squid and bycatch species can be achieved by simple gear modifications.},

We inserted a V-shaped piece of VISIONET ascending on each side of the tapered section just ahead of a divided codend. The length-based effect on the vertical separation of fishes and Nephrops was quantified, and we evaluated if the presence of VISIONET had the potential to increase the fish capture in the upper compartment. Contrary to our expectation, gadoids entered the lower compartment more frequently than in the control trawl. This was similar to that previously found when applying green LED lights in the tapered section, however opposite for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). The flatfishes did not respond. Large Nephrops significantly increased their preference for the lower compartment. Our results show that low intensity light is sufficient to alter the vertical distribution of both fishes and Nephrops. Responses of fishes to different variables, including light intensities, need to be studied in more detail to understand the underlying mechanisms and to ultimately reduce unwanted catch more efficiently. Luminous netting can be integrated in any given trawl design and does not require batteries or electronics.},

Gadoids, in particular haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and saithe (Pollachius virens), were caught in the upper codend, whereas Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) were caught in the lower codends. Catches of flatfish were more uniformly distributed among the three codends. Unlike the flatfish, gadoids reacted to the presence of the separator frame. The camera method and the separator frame yielded different information about fish behaviour within the trawl, and together the two methods provided a more complete picture of the catching process. Behavioural observations, vertical distribution, and the methodology are discussed, as is the potential for improving species separation in demersal trawls.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been tested in trawl fisheries to reduce the bycatch of unwanted species through behavioural stimulation. Previous studies used LED lights to either highlight escaping routes or increase the contact rate with square-mesh panels. However, phototactic responses (moving towards or away from light sources) to LED lights could also be exploited to separate species during the catching process. We investigated if either positive or negative phototaxis can be used to improve fish vertical separation from Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) in the aft section of a horizontally separated trawl codend. The aim was to increase the proportion of fish entering the upper compartment. We conducted two different experiments in front of the separation into compartments, inserting green LED lights in the upper and lower netting panel, respectively. Species vertical separation was analysed and compared in two identical trawls towed in parallel, one equipped with lights and one without. We obtained significant changes in vertical separation, but no clear species-specific phototactic response was identified. Neither of the light positions improved fish separation from Nephrops. However, the potential of LED lights as behavioural stimulators is confirmed, and a more mechanistic understanding of light and fish vision may improve the results of future applications.},

Some of these BRDs could likely benefit from being combined. However, the number of possible combinations would be prohibitive to be tested experimentally. Therefore, in this study we propose a meta-analytical approach that combines the data available on BRDs tested independently in a fishery and predict the theoretical selectivity of all possible combinations of those devices. This allows to identify promising BRD combinations, worth experimental investigation and flexible trawl configurations, where the selectivity can be substantially modified by adding or removing one BRD, thus aiding fishermen in adapting to high variability in catch composition and quota availability. To illustrate the approach, we used BRDs developed for the well-studied Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus, Nephropidae) directed mixed trawl fishery in the Skagerrak and Kattegat seas. We predicted the selectivity of 100 BRD combinations for Nephrops, cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Gadidae), compared them in terms of absolute selectivity and performance under realistic catch scenarios, from both single- and multispecies perspectives, and identified 15 BRD combinations that could be worth future experimental investigation. The meta-analytical approach makes best use of existing knowledge and leads to new insights about the potential for improvement and flexibility in trawl selectivity. This could benefit a variety of mixed trawl fisheries and help developing a new generation of more flexible gears, with multiple BRDs integrated in their structure.},

  abstract = {AbstractFishing with an artificial light stimulus has existed for thousands of years. It started with simple techniques such as burning a large fire on the beach to attract fish, but over the centuries it has become increasingly technologically advanced. Today, the use of artificial light in commercial fishing plays a very important role in contributing to the total catch yield and economy of many industrialized fisheries. In most cases, fishing vessels employ lights at the surface, but more recently, low-powered LED lights installed directly on fishing gear have also become common. Using artificial light in commercial fishing applications appears to produce various outcomes and trade-offs (i.e., positive and negative effects). Positive benefits can include increases in catch rate, reductions in bycatch, and savings in energy, while negative effects can include ecological costs, overfishing, increased bycatch, production of plastic and marine litter, and greenhouse gas emission. This review provides an overview of fish vision in aquatic animals and the use of light in commercial industrialized fisheries, and provides discussion on potential solutions that strengthen the positive effects and minimize the negative effects of using artificial light in fishing applications.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

VPA tends to make only weak assumptions regarding (age-specific) selectivity (asymptotic selectivity and temporal stability of selectivity for the most recent years). In contrast, selectivity is more parametric in ``integrated'' methods, and can be age-, length-, and age- and length-based. The use of parametric selectivity functions tends to reduce estimation variation because fewer parameters have to be estimated, but incorrect choices for the functional form for selectivity can lead to bias. This paper illustrates effects of poor choices for selectivity on the outcomes of stock assessments, outlines methods for evaluating whether a particular choice for selectivity is appropriate using residual diagnostics, and summarizes current ways to select among alternative functional forms for selectivity. This paper also provides a synthesis of the results of past simulation studies which have explored the ability to correctly parameterize selectivity.},

  abstract = {Most European fishing fleets will need to drastically reduce their unwanted catches to comply with new rules of the common fisheries policy. A more practical way to avoid increasing on-board sorting time and issues linked to storage capacity is to prevent unwanted catches in the first place. We assessed the selectivity properties of an experimental fishing gear that combined a 100 mm T90 cylinder with 130 meshes in the extension and a 100 mm T90 codend of 33 meshes (experimental gear) compared to a 100 mm diamond mesh extension and codend (control gear) during commercial trips using twin trawls. Analysis of the relative size composition of catches indicated a significantly higher escapement of small fish of several target species (e.g. Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Raja spp, and Lophius spp) and non-target species (e.g. Capros aper and Gurnards spp) from the T90 experimental trawl compared to the control trawl (n = 49 hauls), resulting in a significant reduction of unwanted catches of Gadidae, Triglidae, and Caproidae. In contrast, non-negligible commercial losses of small grade target gadoid species were observed. Mixed general linear models showed that the proportion of ray, haddock and anglerfish retained per length class decreased with increased tow duration. The T90 experimental gear will perform at a commercial level when targeting monkfish, megrim, rays and large haddock, however fishers are not likely to use this gear when targeting smaller-bodied species such as cephalopods, small haddock, whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and hake (Merluccius merluccius), because the gear is likely to allow large numbers to escape. Selectivity studies often focus on a short list of target species; however, catches of non-target species under quota can be problematic for some fisheries. For example, under the implementation of the Landing Obligation catches of boarfish could choke the French whitefish demersal fisheries in the Celtic sea, as France has no national quota for that species. The device tested constitutes an efficient solution to mitigate catches for such non-target schooling fish.},

  abstract = {Abstract The demand for fish products, which provide crucial protein for humans, is rising as the global population grows. In contrast, fish stock is declining due to human activity, environmental changes and overfishing. Fish monitoring provides valuable support data for effective fishery management and ecosystem conservation. The common monitoring methods are based on manual sampling, which is time-consuming, laborious and intrusive. Imaging sonar is a hydroacoustic system that produces acoustic images similar to optical images by transmitting and receiving sound waves, allowing for in situ monitoring of fish non-intrusively in the dark and turbid water environments where optical cameras are limited. In the last decade, imaging sonar, especially high frequency multibeam forward-looking sonar and side-scan sonar, has been widely used in fish monitoring. We reviewed the literature from the previous decade on the use of these two types of imaging sonar in fish species identification, abundance estimation, length measurement and behaviour analysis, as well as the sonar imagery processing concerning fish. The review results show that these imaging sonars are efficient and effective tools for fish monitoring in complex environments. The challenges include (1) the recognition of small fish forming dense aggregations; (2) species identification, which limits their use in species-specific studies; (3) time-consuming massive data processing. Therefore, advanced algorithms for sonar imagery processing and integrations with other sampling technologies are needed for future development.},
